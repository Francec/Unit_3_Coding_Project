<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: [[Unit 3 Project]]</h1>

<strong>Interaction</strong>: Kinect to set physical vector for sattelites around a black hole.

<strong>Description</strong>: By using the kinect you will be able to control and set the orbit of different sattelites, as well as make them. I was going for a god-like
sort of control of the universe. Able to create, destroy and manipulate planets.
